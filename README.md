<h1> Key Elements</h1>
  <h2>The Map</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The main work with creating the map was focused on creating the path that enemies would travel on and making the enemies travel on that path.</li>
    <li>I also wanted to create regions that only certain towers could be built on and thus created the mountains and lakes that dot the map.</li>
    <li>Finally I limited where the towers could be placed and added the border to the map so nothing could go passed it.  </li>
  </ul>
